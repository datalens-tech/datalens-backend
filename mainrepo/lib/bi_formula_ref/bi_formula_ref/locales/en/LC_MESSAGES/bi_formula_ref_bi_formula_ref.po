"\n"

"inside of. The expression\n"
"```\n"
"AVG(MAX(SUM([Sales] INCLUDE [City]) INCLUDE [Category]))\n"

"```\n"
"AVG(MAX(SUM([Sales] FIXED [City], [Category], [Date]) FIXED [Category], "
"[Date]) FIXED [Date])\n"
"```\n"
"`INCLUDE` or `EXCLUDE` without a list of dimensions results in the same "
"dimensions as the aggregation above or dimensions of the chart if it is the "
"topmost aggregation. `FIXED` without a list means that all data is "
"aggregated in a single group, which can be used to calculate total values.\n"
msgstr ""

"#### LOD Examples {#syntax-lod-examples}\n"
"\n"
"- average daily sum of `[Sales]`: `AVG(SUM([Sales] INCLUDE [Date]))`;\n"

"#### Dimension Compatibility {#syntax-lod-compatibility}\n"
"\n"
"If several aggregations with custom LODs are nested inside another, their "

"Time series functions provide various ways to look up values corresponding "
"to a specific time or offset along a given time axis.\n"
"\n"
"In a certain way this functionality is similar to the window function {ref:"
"LAG}.\n"
"The main difference is that `LAG` is indifferent to the actual values of the "
"dimensions being used, and operates over positional offsets specified in "
"_rows_, while time series functions use specific values and value offsets in "
"date/time units like days, hours or seconds. This makes them sensitive to "
"missing values in data. As a result of this `AGO(SUM([Sales]), [Date], \"year"
"\")` will return `NULL` if the same-date row for the previous year is "
"missing.\n"
"{text:time_series_syntax}\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"## Syntax {#syntax}\n"
"\n"
"Time series functions support extended syntax:\n"
"{text:time_series_signature}\n"
"### BEFORE FILTER BY {#syntax-before-filter-by}\n"
"\n"
"If any fields are listed in `BEFORE FILTER BY`, then the function is "
"calculated before data is filtered using these fields.\n"
"Let's say you are trying to calculate the value of `[Sales]` a year ago from "
"today's date:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"year\", 1)\n"
"```\n"
"and also have a filter in the chart limiting the dates to a specific year "
"(`2018 < [Year] <= 2019`, where `Year` is calculated as `YEAR([Date])`). All "
"data pertaining to the year 2018 will be omitted from the result. Because of "
"this the function will return `NULL`.\n"
"\n"
"If `BEFORE FILTER BY` is added to the function:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"year\", 1 BEFORE FILTER BY [Year])\n"
"```\n"
"it will return the value of `[Sales]`.\n"
"\n"
"The date/time dimension specified as the second argument of time series "
"functions is implicitly added to the `BEFORE FILTER BY` clause. For example, "
"the following to formulas are equivalent:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"week\")\n"
"```\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"week\" BEFORE FILTER BY [Date])\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"### IGNORE DIMENSIONS {#syntax-ignore-dimensions}\n"
"\n"
"The `IGNORE DIMENSIONS` clause allows the exclusion of dimensions from the "
"search criteria. When looking up a value for a certain date, the search is "
"done by matching dimension values in each row against the values of the same "
"dimensions in the original row. If any of the other dimensions correlate "
"with the date dimension, then the data query may return an empty result "
"(`NULL`).\n"
"\n"
"For example, if the data request contains `[Date]`, `[Month]` and "
"`AGO([Sales], [Date], \"month\")`, then it will be impossible to find a row "
"with `[Date]` being a month earlier, but the value of `[Month]` being the "
"same as in the current row. This will result in `AGO` always returning "
"`NULL`.\n"
"\n"
"To get the correct value of `[Sales]` exclude `[Month]` using the `IGNORE "
"DIMENSIONS` clause:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"month\" IGNORE DIMENSIONS [Month])\n"
"```"

"\n"
"1. The first argument in window functions can only be {if ycloud}[measures]"

"measures{end}.\n"
"For the `AVG_IF`, `COUNT_IF`, `SUM_IF` window functions, the first argument "
"(`expression` in the function description) must always be a measure.\n"
"    Example:\n"
"\n"
"    `AVG_IF([Profit], [Profit] > 5)`\n"
"\n"
"For other window functions, the first (and only) argument (`value` in the "
"function description) must always be a measure, too.\n"
"\n"
"    Examples:\n"
"    - Valid: `SUM(SUM([Profit]) TOTAL)`.\n"
"    - Not valid: `RANK([Profit] TOTAL)`, where `[Profit]` is a non-"
"aggregated expression.\n"
"\n"
"1. For grouping window functions, only the {if ycloud}[dimensions](../"
"concepts/dataset/data-model.md#field){end}{if doublecloud}dimensions{end} "
"used to build the chart can be applied. Only the dimensions used to build "
"the chart set the {if ycloud}[grouping when calculating a measure](../"
"concepts/aggregation-tutorial.md#aggregation-in-charts){end}{if doublecloud}"
"grouping when calculating a measure{end}. These dimensions define how values "
"are split into groups and therefore have fixed values in each group.\n"
"\n"
"If you specify a dimension that was not used to build the chart, it won't "
"have a fixed value and the value can be different in each group row. As a "
"result, it will be impossible to determine which value of this dimension "
"must be used to calculate the measure. This limitation applies to the "
"`WITHIN` and `AMONG` grouping types.\n"
"\n"
"    Examples:\n"
"    - Valid: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) WITHIN [Category])` in the chart with "
"grouping by the `[Order Date]` and `[Category]` dimensions.\n"
"    - Allowed: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) WITHIN [City])` in the chart with "
"grouping by the `[Category]` dimension,       `[City]` does not participate "
"in the grouping.\n"
"    - Not valid: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) WITHIN [Category])` in a chart with "
"grouping by the `[Order Date]` and `[City]` dimensions.\n"
"    - Not valid: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) AMONG [City])` in a chart with grouping "
"by the `[Order Date]` and `[Category]` dimensions.\n"
"1. The **Filters** section doesn't affect the chart grouping, so if the "
"dimension is only in this chart section, you can't use it in the window "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"    Example:\n"
"    - Chart type: **Table**.\n"
"    - In the **Columns** section, the `Category` dimension and the "
"`SUM(SUM([Sales] BEFORE FILTER BY [Date])` expression are added.\n"
"    - The `Date` dimension is added to the **Filters** section.\n"
"\n"
"    This will result in an error because the `Date` dimension isn't used to "
"build the chart.\n"
"1. If a window function is used to build a **Table** chart, we don't "
"recommend enabling the display of **Total** in the settings. This may cause "
"an error.\n"

"`dim3`, `dim4` in the data query, then the entries will be grouped by `dim3` "
