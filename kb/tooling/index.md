# Repository Tooling

This section is about the custom tooling available in this repo.

- [task commands](task_commands.md) - a set of (`make`-like) shortcuts for various commands and scripts for repository management, development, testing, etc.
- tools from `terrarium` ([README](../../terrarium/README.md)):
  - [dl-git](../../terrarium/dl_gitmanager/README.md) - a wrapper for advanced git commands, for usage mainly in the CI workflow
  - [dl-repo / dl-package](../../terrarium/dl_repmanager/README.md) - tools for managing and inspecting packages, their dependencies, meta-packages, etc.
