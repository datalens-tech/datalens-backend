        1. First we inspect feature-managed relations that are needed by required avatars (``A0-F1`` in this case)
        and add avatars required by their expressions to ``required_avatar_ids``.

        After this ``required_avatar_ids`` becomes ``{A3, A4, F1, A5}``;
        ``required_relation_ids``: ``{A0-F1}``.

        2. Now, we exclude feature managed avatars (``F1``): ``user_avatar_ids = {A3, A4, A5}``,
        traverse the tree in search of their latest common ancestor (LUCA)
        and add all avatars we encounter on the way (``A2``, ``A1``)

        Finally ``required_avatar_ids = {A3, A4, F1, A5, A2, A1}``;
        ``required_relation_ids``: ``{A0-F1, A1-A2, A1-A3, A1-A5, A2-A4}``.

        3. Then add all avatars which attached to required_avatar_ids via relation required by user
        (AvatarRelation.required) and this required relations
        required_avatar_ids becomes {A3, A4, F1, A5, A2, A1, A6} and
        ``required_relation_ids``: ``{A0-F1, A1-A2, A1-A3, A1-A5, A2-A4, A5-A6}``.

        4. Return LUCA's ID (``A1``), updated ``required_avatar_ids`` and ``required_relation_ids``.
