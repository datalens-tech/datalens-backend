"### Level of Detail (LOD) {#syntax-lod}\n"
"\n"
"Custom LOD make possible nested aggregations and aggregations over the "
"entire set of rows or groups that are different from the grouping at the "
"chart's level.\n"
"\n"
"LOD can be specified using one of three keywords:\n"
"- `FIXED` — data is grouped using the listed dimensions (`dim1, dim2, ...`) "
"regardless of the dimensions used by the chart;\n"
"- `INCLUDE` — the listed dimensions (`dim1, dim2, ...`) are combined with "
"the chart's dimensions;\n"
"- `EXCLUDE` — all of the chart's dimensions are used with the exception of "
"those listed (`dim1, dim2, ...`).\n"
"\n"
"For any of these keywords the list may have any number of dimensions, or "
"even be empty.\n"
"\n"
"Using `INCLUDE` or `EXCLUDE` without a dimension list is equivalent to "
"grouping by dimensions of an external aggregation or by chart dimensions if "
"there are no other aggregations over the current one. `FIXED` without a list "
"means that all data will aggregate into a single group, e.g., for "
"calculating the resulting value.\n"
"\n"
"Top-level aggregations must not contain any dimensions that are missing in "
"the chart. Hence, if you need to add details or group by dimensions that are "
"missing in the chart, you can add them in the lower levels. For example, if "
"you need the maximum sales amount by cities without including data on cities "
"to the chart, use:\n"
"```\n"
"MAX(SUM([Sales] FIXED [City]))\n"

"Time series functions provide various ways to look up values corresponding "
"to a specific time or offset along a given time axis.\n"
"\n"
"In a certain way this functionality is similar to the window function {ref:"
"LAG}.\n"
"The main difference is that `LAG` is indifferent to the actual values of the "
"dimensions being used, and operates over positional offsets specified in "
"_rows_, while time series functions use specific values and value offsets in "
"date/time units like days, hours or seconds. This makes them sensitive to "
"missing values in data. As a result of this `AGO(SUM([Sales]), [Date], "
"\"year\")` will return `NULL` if the same-date row for the previous year is "
"missing.\n"
"\n"
"Time series functions work with specific values or deviations specified in "
"time units (days, hours, or seconds). Due to that, they become sensitive to "
"missing values in data. As the result, the `AGO(SUM([Sales]), [Date], "
"\"year\")` formula will return `NULL` if there is no data for the same date "
"in the previous year. Also, note that when you use data in date and time "
"format, you might have data for the same date, but not for the exact same "
"second. Besides, when rounding dates to weeks, a shift in years will also "
"return `NULL`.\n"

"## Syntax {#syntax}\n"

"Time series functions support extended syntax:\n"

"### BEFORE FILTER BY {#syntax-before-filter-by}\n"
"\n"
"If any fields are listed in `BEFORE FILTER BY`, then the function is "
"calculated before data is filtered using these fields.\n"
"Let's say you are trying to calculate the value of `[Sales]` a year ago from "
"today's date:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"year\", 1)\n"
"```\n"
"and also have a filter in the chart limiting the dates to a specific year "
"(`2018 < [Year] <= 2019`, where `Year` is calculated as `YEAR([Date])`). All "
"data pertaining to the year 2018 will be omitted from the result. Because of "
"this the function will return `NULL`.\n"
"\n"
"If `BEFORE FILTER BY` is added to the function:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"year\", 1 BEFORE FILTER BY [Year])\n"
"```\n"
"it will return the value of `[Sales]`.\n"
"\n"
"The date/time dimension specified as the second argument of time series "
"functions is implicitly added to the `BEFORE FILTER BY` clause. For example, "
"the following to formulas are equivalent:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"week\")\n"
"```\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"week\" BEFORE FILTER BY [Date])\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"### IGNORE DIMENSIONS {#syntax-ignore-dimensions}\n"
"\n"
"The `IGNORE DIMENSIONS` clause allows the exclusion of dimensions from the "
"search criteria. When looking up a value for a certain date, the search is "
"done by matching dimension values in each row against the values of the same "
"dimensions in the original row. If any of the other dimensions correlate "
"with the date dimension, then the data query may return an empty result "
"(`NULL`).\n"
"\n"
"For example, if the data request contains `[Date]`, `[Month]` and "
"`AGO([Sales], [Date], \"month\")`, then it will be impossible to find a row "
"with `[Date]` being a month earlier, but the value of `[Month]` being the "
"same as in the current row. This will result in `AGO` always returning "
"`NULL`.\n"
"\n"
"To get the correct value of `[Sales]` exclude `[Month]` using the `IGNORE "
"DIMENSIONS` clause:\n"
"```\n"
"AGO([Sales], [Date], \"month\" IGNORE DIMENSIONS [Month])\n"

"Aggregate functions are calculated from groups of values that are determined "

"## Usage Restrictions {#usage-restrictions}\n"
"\n"
"1. The first argument in window functions can only be {link:"
"field_concept_link:measures}.\n"
"For the `AVG_IF`, `COUNT_IF`, `SUM_IF` window functions, the first argument "
"(`expression` in the function description) must always be a measure.\n"
"    Example:\n"
"\n"
"    `AVG_IF([Profit], [Profit] > 5)`\n"
"\n"
"For other window functions, the first (and only) argument (`value` in the "
"function description) must always be a measure, too.\n"
"\n"
"    Examples:\n"
"    - Valid: `SUM(SUM([Profit]) TOTAL)`.\n"
"    - Not valid: `RANK([Profit] TOTAL)`, where `[Profit]` is a non-"
"aggregated expression.\n"
"\n"
"1. For grouping window functions, only the {link:field_concept_link:"
"dimensions} used to build the chart can be applied. Only the dimensions used "
"to build the chart set the {link:chart_aggregation_link:grouping when "
"calculating a measure}. These dimensions define how values are split into "
"groups and therefore have fixed values in each group.\n"
"\n"
"If you specify a dimension that was not used to build the chart, it won't "
"have a fixed value and the value can be different in each group row. As a "
"result, it will be impossible to determine which value of this dimension "
"must be used to calculate the measure. This limitation applies to the "
"`WITHIN` and `AMONG` grouping types.\n"
"\n"
"    Examples:\n"
"    - Valid: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) WITHIN [Category])` in the chart with "
"grouping by the `[Order Date]` and `[Category]` dimensions.\n"
"    - Allowed: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) WITHIN [City])` in the chart with "
"grouping by the `[Category]` dimension,       `[City]` does not participate "
"in the grouping.\n"
"    - Not valid: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) WITHIN [Category])` in a chart with "
"grouping by the `[Order Date]` and `[City]` dimensions.\n"
"    - Not valid: `RANK(SUM([Profit]) AMONG [City])` in a chart with grouping "
"by the `[Order Date]` and `[Category]` dimensions.\n"
"1. The **Filters** section doesn't affect the chart grouping, so if the "
"dimension is only in this chart section, you can't use it in the window "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"    Example:\n"
"    - Chart type: **Table**.\n"
"    - In the **Columns** section, the `Category` dimension and the "
"`SUM(SUM([Sales] BEFORE FILTER BY [Date])` expression are added.\n"
"    - The `Date` dimension is added to the **Filters** section.\n"
"\n"
"    This will result in an error because the `Date` dimension isn't used to "
"build the chart.\n"
"1. If a window function is used to build a **Table** chart, we don't "
"recommend enabling the display of **Total** in the settings. This may cause "
"an error.\n"

"`dim3`, `dim4` in the data query, then the entries will be grouped by `dim3` "
