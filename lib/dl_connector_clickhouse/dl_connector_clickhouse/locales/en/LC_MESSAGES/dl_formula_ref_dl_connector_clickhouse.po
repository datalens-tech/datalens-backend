"For {dialects:CLICKHOUSE} data sources, numeric {arg:0} values less than or "
"equal to `65535` are interpreted as the number of days (not seconds, like in "
"all other cases) since January 1st 1970. This is the result of the behavior "
"of available {dialects:CLICKHOUSE} functions.\n"
"\n"
"One way to surpass this is to use the following formula: "
"`DATE(DATETIME([value]))`. The result is more consistent, but is likely to "
"be much slower."

"Due to implementation details of the {type:FLOAT} type in {dialects:"
"CLICKHOUSE} sources it is recommended to use the {ref:COMPARE} function "
"instead of comparison operators for this type."
